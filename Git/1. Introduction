Source Code
  - Instructions written by programmers
  - Usually text files in a programming language
  - Basis for executed computer programs

Source Code Management (SCM)
  - System for tracking changes in code
  - Manages source code repositories
  - Facilitates team collaboration on code

Version Control System (VCS)
  - It tracks and manage changes to a software code over time
  - It facilitate collaboration, allowing multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously
  - It enables reverting to previous vesion and history and documentation of code development.
  - Examples:
    - Git
        - Distributed VCS, widely used for its flexibility and offline capabilities
    - Subversion (SVN)
        - Centralized VCS that maintains version history on a central server
    - Concurrent Version System (CVS)
        - One of the oldest VCS, its centralized and laid the foundation for many other VCS tools
    - BitKeeper
        - A istributed VCS by Canonical, designed to be easy to use and adaptable to a variety of workflows
    - TFS (Team Foundation Server)
        - A centralized VCS integrated with Microsoft's application lifecycle management tools

Difference between SCM and VCS
  - SCM includes broader aspects of code management including branching, merging, and repository hosting, while VCS specifically deals with the change history of files
  - VCS is a component of SCM; VCS focuses on verioning, SCM encompasses overall code lifecycle management
  - SCM often includes tools for build, testing, and deployment, going beyond the scope of mere version control offered by VCS
